## About Forked Project:

This project was forked by myself with the intention to convert the ubuntu-post-install script into a WSL post-install script. I tend to run 2-3 WSL instances (Ubuntu WSL2, Alpine WSL1) and wanted to create a script to automate this process. Turns out forking an existing project was easier...

To start with I will focus on the Ubuntu WSL instance but will also include alpine-post-install eventually. Uses my wsl-dot-files project as a template for .zshrc and .bashrc changes - https://github.com/JackTheFlap/wsl-dot-files

## Original About:

Ubuntu Post Install Script is a simple bash script for automating the reconfiguration of a fresh Ubuntu installation â€“installing favourite applications, setting up configurations, etc. 

It is compatible with both 32 and 64 bit architectures
